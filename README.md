# Diabetes-Classification-Project-ML-DL

This is a **machine learning project** designed to predict whether a person has **diabetes** using features like **age, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness**, etc.  
It includes a simple **web interface** built with **HTML and CSS**.

The notebook `Diabetes Classification.ipynb` handles data analysis, model testing, and selection.  
The **Random Forest Classifier** performed best on the dataset.

ðŸ“„ The report is available in `ML-Proj-Report.pdf`.



## How to Run:

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` using:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. To train the model yourself, run:  
   `Diabetes Predictor - Deployment.py`  
   It will generate:  
   `diabetes-prediction-rfc-model.pkl`

3. Start the app using:  
   `app.py`

4. The interface uses:  
   - `index.html` (input form)  
   - `result.html` (result display)
