# Diabetes-Classification-Project-Ml-Dl
This is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a person has diabetes using features like age, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, etc. It includes a simple web interface built with HTML and CSS.

The notebook Diabetes Classification.ipynb handles data analysis, model testing, and selection. The Random Forest Classifier performed best on the dataset.

The report is available in ML-Proj-Report.pdf.
How to Run:
Install dependencies from requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt.

To train the model yourself, run Diabetes Predictor - Deployment.py. It will generate diabetes-prediction-rfc-model.pkl.

Start the app by running app.py.

The interface uses index.html and result.html for input and output.
